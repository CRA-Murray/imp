# Dipeptide Examples

Here, we have two scripts that manipulate dipeptide dihedral angles using ProteinKinematics

## Alanine dipeptide and CHARMM
`imp_build/setup_environment.py python AA_charmm_test.py`

This example enumerates the two alanine dipeptide dihedrals and computes the CHARMM score after a short minimization.
Dihedrals are kept fixed by a large harmonic restraint during minimization.

Outputs are found in AA_charmm_out

* ala_dipeptide_grid.rmf - RMF file of dihedral sampling
* enumerate_phi_psi.dat - output file with dihedral angles and scores

`python plot_AA_pmf.py` creates a 2D heatmap of the PMF created by the above enumeration.
Note it will NOT look like the true alanine dipetide PMF without significant minimization.


## A-S Enumeration

`imp_build/setup_environment.py python AS_enumerate.py`

enumerates along a grid the dihedral angles of dipeptide A-S, so two backbone dihedrals
and one side-chain dihedral. The CHARMM score for each dihedral configuration is computed.

The output, in AS_enumerate/enumerate_50.dat is of format:
>> Total_score phi psi chi1 [Bond_score Angle_score Dihedral_score LJ_score NB_score Constant]
`>> 4.45446899418887 -0.0 -0.0 -0.0 [1.242520272738658, 1.6492662651385117, 5.000540653892964, 6.404827741077816, 0.15731406134092188, -10.0]`
